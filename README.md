# ROVader

## What is it?

ROVader is a mod that is a Testing Bed for all of my Mods before being Pulled Requested into the Realism Overhaul Suite of Mods.

## Why is it needed?

To Test my Mods Of course.

## Who deserves the credit?

All the modders that used their time and considerable skills to develop the models, animations and textures that you see represented in game. Each part that is included includes reference to the original modder that created the part. In all situations I have respected the licenses (as far as I know) and asked authors that could be reached if I could obtain permission for non-shareable like licenses if I could include them. If you find anything that you do not think should belong, please let me know and I will remove them.
